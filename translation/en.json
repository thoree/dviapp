  "Introduction_long_1": "This app deals with Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) problems and\npower calculation for kinship problems. Our goal has been to make\navailable functionality in the `pedsuite` of R libraries and also the\n`dvir` library. We also expand on functionality in the [Familias\nsoftware.](https://www.familias.no/)\n\nThere are three modules, all based on built in cases or user data\n(Familias or R files):\n\n-   **Power:** Simulations can be done to determine if goals are likely\n    to be achieved.\n-   **Priority:** The aim is to find the optimal extra persons to\n    genotype.\n-   **DVI:** Methods to include or exclude missing persons are provided.\n\nFor more information, check the books: [Mass\nidentications,](https://www.elsevier.com/books/mass-identifications/kling/978-0-12-818423-3)\n(Kling et al., 2021), [Pedigree Analysis in\nR](https://www.elsevier.com/books/pedigree-analysis-in-r/vigeland/978-0-12-824430-2)\n(Vigeland, 2021), and the [dvir\npaper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93071-5) (Vigeland and\nEgeland, 2021).

  "Prioritise_long_1": "The below explanation applies to the example obtained if \\'brother\\'\n(default) is chosen in the pull down menu below. The LR comparing H1:\n\\`MP and REF full brothers\\`, to H2: \\`MP and REF unrelated\\`, has been\ncomputed for 100 unconditional simulations of MP and REF conditioned on\nH1 below. This corresponds to the \\`REF\\` case in the panel to the\nright. We see that we can expect no exclusions (in fact exclusions are\nimpossible with only two brothers) and log10(LR) slightly exceeding 10.\nIf one brother, \\`E1\\` is genotyped we can expect more than 10\nexclusions and a log10(LR) slightly exceeding 20. Finally, if both\nbrothers \\`E1\\`and \\`E2\\` are genotyped, the expected number of\nexclusions and LR increase further. 10 profiles are simulated for the\nrelatives (\\'REF\\', \\`E1\\` and \\`E2\\`), assuming H1. For each of these\n10 profiles, corresponding to the smaller circles, 1000 simulations are\nperformed for \\`MP\\` under H1 and H2. In \\`Prioritise \\> Analyses based\non built in cases\\` simulations can be performed for various parameter\nchoices. In \\`Prioritise \\> Analyses based on user loaded data\\` similar\nsimulations can be performed from a fam file.",
